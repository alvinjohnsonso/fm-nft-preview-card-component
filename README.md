## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Complete usage of flexbox.
- Absolute positioning within divs.
- Sass preprocessor and the [7-1 (7 folders 1 file) pattern](https://itnext.io/structuring-your-sass-projects-c8d41fa55ed4)
- Was trying out the Mobile-first workflow but I'm not sure if I was able to apply it correctly here since I just set the viewport height to `100` and didn't bother to do any media queries to have it responsive.
- rem vs px

### Continued development

- CSS Grid
- CSS Transitions and animations for fluidity.
- Usage of web frameworks (React JS, Vue JS, etc.)
- Usage of pre-compilers (Webpack)

### Useful resources

- [Structuring your Sass Projects](https://itnext.io/structuring-your-sass-projects-c8d41fa55ed4) - This helped me for the Sass file structure. As stated above, this is where I got the 7-1 pattern for the file structure.
- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Familarity for using flexbox.
